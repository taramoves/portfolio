    artistName: "Tara Rose Morris",
    
    bio: `Tara Rose Morris is a mixed desi new media artist based in Tkaronto (Toronto), Canada. She uses technology to create live performances, immersive installations, and artifacts that propose fantastical worlds of embodiment and belonging. She is particularly interested into the "invisible interstices that lie between the frames" (McLaren, n.d.), taking frames to mean not just keyframes but also bodies, identities, contexts, datapoints, structures and interstices to mean not just inbetweens but also connections, abstractions, memory, latent space, translations, flickers. She sees technology as a threshold to spaces that refuse these "frames", allowing us access into liminal ontologies that allow us to connect more deeply with self and with each other.

She has shown various video and VR standalone works, including with Gray Area, SXSW XR, VIFF Signals, Superchief Gallery, and NFT NOW. She has developed real-time visual projections for InterAccess, Zora, and Superchief Gallery. She has been an artist in residence with AVAX and Nebraska Art Farm and she is currently a member of NEW INC Y11, focusing on art and code.

She has a BA in Media Studies from Pomona College and an MSc in Fiction and Entertainment from SCIArc.`,
