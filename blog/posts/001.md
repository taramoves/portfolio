*All roads lead to dome*, I thought to myself as I stared up into the projected abyss of a blurred gradient eye and it stared back. It's impossible to express the seismic shift (I suppose it is possible, as that is what I am expressing here) I felt in my body and brain as I reckoned with the collective virtual reality of the dome. Ideas around spectacle, embodiment, performance, and speculative world building clarified where they used to feel disconnected and incomplete. Projects that had always felt unfinished or unsatisfying when constrained to tiny or even massive rectangles suddenly made sense. I haven't stopped thinking about the dome since. I'm going to dedicate my life to the dome.
